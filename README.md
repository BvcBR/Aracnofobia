# 🕷️ Arachnophobia
Sharing a "vintage" project from my personal archive. I developed this game entirely in 2016 at the age of 12. While it is a little bit messy, it works!

# 📖 About the Game
This is a survival dodging game built around a simple but stressful concept: Fear.

You play as a character with severe arachnophobia. The goal is simple but difficult:

Dodge the spiders: They come from all sides and vary in speed.

Survive: The longer you last, the higher your score.

# 🛠️ Technology
Engine: GameMaker Studio (Legacy)

Language: GML (GameMaker Language)

Year Built: 2016

# 🚀 How to Run the Project
This project is stored as a .gmz file, which is a compressed project package from older versions of GameMaker (GameMaker: Studio 1.4).

To open and play this:

Download GameMaker: You will need GameMaker Studio 2 (it is backward compatible) or the legacy GameMaker: Studio 1.4 if you have access to it.

Import the Project:

Open GameMaker.

Select Import.

Choose the Arachnophobia.gmz file.

Note: It will ask to convert the project to the new format. This is normal.

Run: Press F5 or click the "Play" button to compile and launch the game.
